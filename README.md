# assemblycomparator2

Assemblycomparator is a genomes-to-report pipeline. It is a bit like nullarbor, but it takes in genomes (assemblies) instead of reads. 

It works by calling an alias that invokes the activation of a conda environment and subsequently calls a snakemake pipeline on the fasta-files in the current working directory of your terminal.

Assemblycomparator performs a palette of analyses on your genomes, and compares them. The main results from these analyses are summarized in a html-report that can be easily distributed.

## Usage
Make a directory with the assembly-files you want to investigate with assemblycomparator2. 
Go into that directory in the terminal, and run the command `assemblycomparator2_slurm` or `assemblycomparator2_local`. 
assemblycomparator2 will then create a sub-directory containing a plethora of analyses. 

#### Some useful commands
  - Execute a 'dry run'. That is, show the jobs which will run, without triggering the computation:
    
    `assemblycomparator2 -n`
    
  - Simply, run assemblycomparator on the genomes in the current directory:

    `assemblycomparator2`
    
  - If you're not sure your internet connection to the cluster will last for the full assemblycomparator2 run, put a `&` in the end.
  
    `assemblycomparator2 &`
    
##### A bit more advanced controls 
    
  - Execute all jobs up until (inclusive of) a specific job in the job graph:
    
    `assemblycomparator2 --until mlst`
    
  - Select a specific MLST-scheme to use on all of the samples: (defaults to automatic)
    
    `assemblycomparator2 --config mlst_scheme=hpylori`
    
  - Select a specific roary blastp-identity: (defaults to 95)

    `assemblycomparator2 --config roary_blastp_identity=90`
    
  - Rerun a specific rule, (might be necessary if some parts of the report is missing):

    `assemblycomparator2 -R report`

## Installation

Assemblycomparator2 needs Snakemake and the dependencies which can be needed for running on your specific setup. I.e. DRMAA for Slurm-mananged HPC's.
You can either follow the [official Snakemake instructions](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) or use our guide below.


### 1. Preliminary Setup

* We recommend that you use a base environment with mamba to start the pipeline:
   ```
   conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
   ```

* Set the base directory for assemblycomparator2. If neccessary, you can change it to anything you'd like.
   ``` 
   ASSCOM2_BASE=~/assemblycomparator2
   
   mkdir -p $ASSCOM2_BASE
    
   # And save it into your .bashrc
   echo "export ASSCOM2_BASE=$ASSCOM2_BASE" >> ~/.bashrc 
    
   ```
 * Clone the assemblycomparator2 GitHub-repository into that base
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cmkobel/assemblycomparator2.git $ASSCOM2_BASE
   
   # Optionally use the git protocol:
   # git clone git@github.com:cmkobel/assemblycomparator2.git $ASSCOM2_BASE
   
   # Setup a asscom2 base environment which is used to call snakemake
   cd $ASSCOM2_BASE && mamba env create -f environment.yaml
   
   
   ```
   
 * Set an alias that makes it easy to run assemblycomparator2 from anywhere in your filesystem
 * You have to decide whether you want to use Singularity (recommended if possible) or Conda for package management.

   
### 2. Install the alias 

Select A or B depending on whether you want to install on a slurm-enabled HPC or a local system without slurm.

#### Option A) For <ins>HPCs</ins> with Slurm using <ins>Conda</ins>
   ```
   # Main alias for running assemblycomparator2
   echo "alias assemblycomparator2='conda run --live-stream --name assemblycomparator2 \
       snakemake --snakefile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/snakefile \
           --profile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/profiles/slurm/ \
           --configfile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/config.yaml'" >> ~/.bashrc

   # Set the SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX-variable, so the package installations can be reused between runs.
   echo "export SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX=${ASSCOM2_BASE}/conda_base" >> ~/.bashrc 
    
   ```
   
   
#### Option B) For <ins>local</ins> setups using <ins>Conda</ins>
   ```
   # Main alias for running assemblycomparator2
   echo "alias assemblycomparator2='conda run --live-stream --name assemblycomparator2 \
       snakemake --snakefile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/snakefile \
           --profile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/profiles/local/ \
           --configfile ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/config.yaml'" >> ~/.bashrc
   
   # Set the SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX-variable, so the package installations can be reused between runs.
   echo "export SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX=${ASSCOM2_BASE}/conda_base" >> ~/.bashrc 
    
   ```
   
   
### Testing installation (optional)

assemblycomparator2 comes with a handful of E. faecium assemblies (illumina/skesa) which can be used to check that everything works as expected. In order to run this test, simply go into the location of these assemblies, and run the `assemblycomparator2`-command
   ```
   cd ${ASSCOM2_BASE}/tests/E._faecium_plasmids
   assemblycomparator2
    
   ```

If you encounter problems installing, testing or using assemblycomparator2, please refer to the issues tab of this repository.

   
   
### Updating an existing installation (optional)

If you should -later down the line- wish to update the installation, run this command and you should be all set:
```
cd $ASSCOM2_BASE && git pull

# You might also want to update snakemake
conda env update --name assemblycomparator2 --file environment.yaml

# If you wish to update the job-environments, you can simply delete the contents of $SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX
rm -r $SNAKEMAKE_CONDA_PREFIX/* 
# .. The environments will then be reinstalled from scratch next time you run assemblycomparator2

```
Note: If new databases have been added to kraken or mashscreen, you can rerun the above-mentioned set_up_*.sh-scripts.
