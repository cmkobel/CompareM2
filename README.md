üß¨ CompareM2 is a genomes-to-report pipeline. It accepts prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) genomic assemblies and compares them in many different ways. 

ü¶† Being designed to analyze assemblies of both isolates and metagenomes (MAGs), it is useful for anyone working with microbial genomics.

üíæ [Installing](https://comparem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10%20installation/) CompareM2 on your system gives you access to [many](https://comparem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/30%20what%20analyses%20does%20it%20do/) powerful state-of-the-art tools for analysis of prokaryotic genomes which will accelerate your research. It is easy to use and can be used by non-bioinformaticians.

üë©‚Äçüî¨ CompareM2 integrates several analyses that yield scientific results about genomic assemblies on several levels: Quality control, annotation, function and species calling as well as comparative analyses like computation of core/pan genomes and phylogenetics. 

üêç CompareM2 works by calling a Snakemake workflow that can be easily modified to use different parameters for the  underlying tools.

üìô Central results are dynamically integrated in a compact portable report .html-document. It can be browsed in any web browser and can be easily shared as a single file. This report is generated even if some jobs in the pipeline fail. [See examples](https://comparem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/30%20what%20analyses%20does%20it%20do/#rendered-report).

üßë‚Äçüíª CompareM2 can be run either on a local workstation (recommended >= 64GiB RAM), or a HPC (high performance computing) cluster. Both  Apptainer/Singularity/Docker images and conda environment definitions are available for all dependent software to run.
