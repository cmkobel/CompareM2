Assemblycomparator2 is a genomes to report pipeline. It distributes a large number of software tools to analyze bacterial and archaeal genomes, and can be used to compare both isolates and MAGs (metagenome assembled genomes). It generates a visual report that can be easily shared.

It is based on snakemake. Uses Conda to automatically install the individual tools and also has a Docker image that speeds up installation. It automatically downloads necessary databases.

The comprehensible documentation is available at https://assemblycomparator2.readthedocs.org
