## Mashtree phylogeny

[Mashtree](https://github.com/lskatz/mashtree) computes an approximation of ANI using the minhash distance measure. On these distances, a phylogenetic tree is then created using the neighbor-joining algorithm. The plotted tree is not rooted.


```{r mashtree, echo=FALSE, message=F, warning=F, error = T, fig_height = max(3, N*0.6), fig_width = 10}

mashtree_file = glob_list$mashtree

tree <- ape::read.tree(mashtree_file)

#tree = phytools::midpoint.root(tree)
#devtools::install_github("igraph/rigraph")
#tree = phangorn::midpoint(tree)

#plot(tree)
#axis(1)

#tree$tip.label = paste0(" ", tree$tip.label)
#phytools::plotTree(tree, align.tip.label = T, lwd = 1, mar = c(0,0,0,0))
#axis(1)

tree$tip.label = paste0(" ", tree$tip.label)
ape::plot.phylo(tree, align.tip.label = T, font = 1, cex = 0.73)
axis(1)
           

```
