# Future functionality 

In the future we might add some of the following software packages into Assemblycomparator2.

**Assembly basis (within each sample)**
  - [Bakta](https://github.com/oschwengers/bakta/) Rapid & standardized annotation of bacterial genomes, MAGs & plasmids.
  - MCF Module Completion Fraction as an extension to the KEGG-based pathway enrichment analysis that helps interpretation.
  - [AlphaFold](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold) Neural network protein folding prediction genome annotation.
  - Integration of the [DRAM](https://github.com/WrightonLabCSU/DRAM) databases for easier metabolic interpretation.
  - [Eggnogg-mapper](https://github.com/eggnogdb/eggnog-mapper) Functional annotation of novel sequences.
  - [Oriloc](http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/Oriloc/oriloc.html) Identification of possible replication origins of chromids.
  - [RFplasmid](https://github.com/aldertzomer/RFPlasmid) Identification of plasmids using the pentamer-random-forest method.
  - [mash screen](https://mash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html) Recognition of plasmids-of-interest.
  - [Kaptive](https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive) Identification of surface polysaccharide loci for Klebsiella and Acinetobacter baumannii.
  - [AMRFinderPlus](https://github.com/ncbi/amr/) Identification of AMR genes and their point mutations.
  - [gapseq](https://github.com/jotech/gapseq/tree/master) GEMs, pathway completeness and much more.


**Batch basis (across all samples)**

  - GC3-profiling "fingerprinting" of the distribution of GC-content.
  - Recombination in core genome using the Bruen's PHI statistic.
  - Identification of horizontally transferred genes?
  - [GenAPI](https://github.com/MigleSur/GenAPI) Roary alternative.
  - [panaroo](https://github.com/gtonkinhill/panaroo) A Bacterial Pangenome Analysis Pipeline.
