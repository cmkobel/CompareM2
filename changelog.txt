2.9.1
  - Breaking change: new passthrough parameter system rolled out to most rules.
  - Update cite value to reflect preprint doi https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.603264 
  - Add more tools to passthrough argument feature. And write documentation.
  - Fixed an error that meant that panaroo was using the Prokka annotation (.gff) regardless of the annotator being set with --config annotator=[bakta|prokka].
  - Fixed an error that meant that both Bakta and Prokka would run even though the user had selected one with --config annotator=[bakta|prokka]. Thanks to @michoug
  - Minor fixes.

2.8.2
  -Â Add --cite parameter to executable.
  - New more differentiated logo for cli.
  - Prints report sections in the end of the dynamic report pipeline.
  - Explicit option to run prokka in archaea mode.
  - config setting prokka_rfam is false by default.
  - Brought Panaroo options out into config.
  - Docker image follows minor version only. So all subsequent patches will use the same Docker image for Apptainer.
  - New passthrough parameter system where parameters and arguments are automatically unpacked for each rule. Generalized implementation.
  - Minor fixes.

2.8.1
  - Breaking change: Changed named from Assemblycomparator2 to CompareM2.
  - Compressed test files.
  - Updated header text.
  - Bring back the ass.
  - Add --no-check-certificate to wget downloads.
  - Added missing localrules for download rules.
  - In profiles, decrease latency and add rerun-incomplete: true.
  - Increase memory requirement for Bakta.
  - Use dbcan_build to install that database.
  - Disable antismash until issue is resolved.
  - Updated the busco report section so it accepts the .faa file that was added in v2.7.1.
  - Add tmpdir to eggnog.
  - Compute md5sum of input genome in rule copy.
  - Minor fixes.

2.7.1
  - Breaking change: File hierarchy now follows what is recommended in the snakemake documentation. Rules are now in individual files.
  - Breaking change: profiles/ moved to profile/ (sorry). And local profiles are now named "default".
  - Busco runs in protein mode, reusing .faa from prokka (or bakta - see further down). Should result in speedup.
  - Added Panaroo, removed Roary.
  - For dbcan, only the substrates are shown in the dynamic report.
  - Gtdb updated to release 220.0
  - Add bakta.
  - User can specify whether to use prokka or bakta to create annotation that is used for dbcan, interproscan diamond_kegg, busco. This can be set using `--config annotator=bakta` or by changing the permanent parameter in config/config.yaml.
  - Add eggnog
  - rename benchmark files from individual->Sample
  - Add antismash. Uses .gbk from prokka.
  - report_subpipeline renamed to dynamic_report
  - Dynamic report is now run by the ./comparem2 binary instead of using onsuccess/onerror.
  - Minor fixes.
  - Software versions and database versions are written to hidden files within output directories.
  - Added dynamic parameters to prokka and iqtree to the config file.
  - Added support for a "fofn" which is a file of file names. In the tseemann style, it defines which input genomes to process.
  - Use KEGG KO from eggnog in kegg_pathway. If this doesn't work well I'll consider re-implementing kofam_scan which was removed long time back. Now a_class and b_class are "class" and "group".
  - Implemented a way to set the output directory which now defaults to the old static "results_comparem2".
  - Implemented TreeCluster that on the 4.5% and 10% basis defines clusters on the mashtree distances so the user can easily get an impression on the relative differences between samples.
  - Fix an error that makes snp-dists results not show up in the report. (Thanks to @AstaLaugesen)
  - Added documentation over at https://comparem2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

2.6.2
  - Fix wrong path for dbcan results (not yet implemented in report)
  - Downgrade diamond 2.1.8 due to segfault in newest version (2.1.9) https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/issues/785

2.6.1
  - Remove Kraken2, hence new minor version. Kraken2 really only makes sense on reads. 
  - Roary as a checkpoint, to only continue with iqtree, fasttree and snp-dists if the core genome is non-empty.
  - conda yaml for wget. TODO, carry over to dbcan download as well.

2.5.18
  - Support for weird characters in input files. #31
  - Support for adding input files from other directories. #58
  - Minor bugfixes. #77
  - Test battery is being developed. (https://github.com/cmkobel/comparem2-test-battery)

2.5.17
  - Forced recompilation of docker image did not fix issue #74. This patch has equivalent .yaml-files to version 2.5.14, which means that the old (working) docker image will be compatible.

2.5.16
  - Indirect bug because of an uncaught docker error. Forced recompilation of the image should fix that.
  - Propagation of version string to easy version bumping.

2.5.15
  - Limited snakemake version because of breaking dependency changes herein.

2.5.14
  - problems with dockerfile fixed

2.5.13
  - Bugfix: Wrong number of bootstraps for quicktree

2.5.12
  - motulizer.yaml was missing.

2.5.11
  - Added support for motulizer and motupan. Yet lacking in report and awaits further integration.

2.5.10
  - comparem2 now supports iqtree with bootstrapping. Runs on the core genome produced by roary. Yet to be included in the report.

2.5.9
  - Fixed an error where checkm2 would fail setting the download location internally when running comparem2 using the apptainer/docker container. https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2/issues/73

2.5.8
  - Fixed an error where a different version of the docker image would be pulled for the report subpipeline
  
2.5.7 
  - Fixed an error where a conda environment would not be activated when using the apptainer profile for slurm.

2.5.6
  - New ./comparem2 "binary" to replace the old alias. This "binary" comes with default environment variables.

2.5.5
  - Use $ASSCOM_DATABASES to define where the databases are placed. 
  - Docker images have a versioning system so an incompatible image can't be used.

2.5.4
  - Using the mashtree order in plots in the report. Using alphabetical order redundantly in case mashtree hasn't run (sucessfully). Minor adjustments to other plots. TODO: midpoint root tree somehow and order all tables in the report as well.

2.5.3
  - Using snakemake's --containerize to automatically generate images which are then synced to dockerhub as cmkobel/comparem2. Support for hpc queues isn't yet tested.

2.5.2
  - dbcan, including download
  - interproscan
  - both dbcan and interproscan are yet to be integrated in the report

2.5.0
  - Apptainer support. New profiles for apptainer or conda use.

2.4.1
  - Adjusting the new report and fix minor bugs

2.4.0
  - New report based on child sections

2.3.0
- Disabled pathway enrichment as conda failed
- Implemented GTDB-tk
- Having problems with Prokka

2.2.0
- Sample pathway enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler which is integrated into the report.
- Considering going away from singularity: Too much maintenance and too little return when it has to work with conda anyway. I haven't completely decided yet, but leaning strongly.

2.1.1
- Simple GC statistics added to output and report 

2.1.0
- Bug and stability issues fixed

2.0.0
- Completely new system based on snakemake using both slurm and singularity
