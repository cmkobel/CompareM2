2.5.11
  - Added support for motulizer and motupan. Yet lacking in report and awaits further integration.

2.5.10
  - assemblycomparator2 now supports iqtree with bootstrapping. Runs on the core genome produced by roary. Yet to be included in the report.

2.5.9
  - Fixed an error where checkm2 would fail setting the download location internally when running asscom2 using the apptainer/docker container. https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2/issues/73

2.5.8
  - Fixed an error where a different version of the docker image would be pulled for the report subpipeline
  
2.5.7 
  - Fixed an error where a conda environment would not be activated when using the apptainer profile for slurm.

2.5.6
  - New ./asscom2 "binary" to replace the old alias. This "binary" comes with default environment variables.

2.5.5
  - Use $ASSCOM_DATABASES to define where the databases are placed. 
  - Docker images have a versioning system so an incompatible image can't be used.

2.5.4
  - Using the mashtree order in plots in the report. Using alphabetical order redundantly in case mashtree hasn't run (sucessfully). Minor adjustments to other plots. TODO: midpoint root tree somehow and order all tables in the report as well.

2.5.3
  - Using snakemake's --containerize to automatically generate images which are then synced to dockerhub as cmkobel/assemblycomparator2. Support for hpc queues isn't yet tested.

2.5.2
  - dbcan, including download
  - interproscan
  - both dbcan and interproscan are yet to be integrated in the report

2.5.0
  - Apptainer support. New profiles for apptainer or conda use.


2.4.1
  - Adjusting the new report and fix minor bugs

2.4.0
  - New report based on child sections

2.3.0
- Disabled pathway enrichment as conda failed
- Implemented GTDB-tk
- Having problems with Prokka

2.2.0
- Sample pathway enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler which is integrated into the report.
- Considering going away from singularity: Too much maintenance and too little return when it has to work with conda anyway. I haven't completely decided yet, but leaning strongly.

2.1.1
- Simple GC statistics added to output and report 


2.1.0
- Bug and stability issues fixed

2.0.0
- Completely new system based on snakemake using both slurm and singularity


REMINDER
Remember to bump: snakefile, report snakefile, the genomes_to_report_v3.Rmd besides this file.
