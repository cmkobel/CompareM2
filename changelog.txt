2.5.3
  - Using snakemake's --containerize to automatically generate images which are then synced to dockerhub as cmkobel/assemblycomparator2. Support for hpc queues isn't yet tested.

  - dbcan, including download
  - interproscan
  - both dbcan and interproscan are yet to be integrated in the report

  - Apptainer support. New profiles for apptainer or conda use.


2.4.1
  - Adjusting the new report and fix minor bugs

2.4.0

- Disabled pathway enrichment as conda failed
- Implemented GTDB-tk
- Having problems with Prokka

2.2.0
- Sample pathway enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler which is integrated into the report.
- Considering going away from singularity: Too much maintenance and too little return when it has to work with conda anyway. I haven't completely decided yet, but leaning strongly.

2.1.0
